Present To Glass - Client
=====================

Client for communicating presentation notes to Present To Glass Glassware.

This software will listen to the Glassware part of this 2 part software. The client will send the notes to Glass in time with the presentation.

Currently autocueing presentations are not supported as the client needs to listen in for the keyboard events of the device.
